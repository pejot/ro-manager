ro-manager

This project is a command-line Research Object management tool, following the specification at http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+management+tool, which is in turn derived from http://www.wf4ever-project.org/wiki/display/docs/RO+command+line+tool.  Details of the command line interface are expected to evolve as the software is developed.
