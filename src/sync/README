Supported operations are (in the first iteration):
- create workspace
- create RO
- create RO version
- create or update manifest.rdf
- create or update a file or directory

In the first iteration, operations will comply with ROSRS version 3:
- authentication will be done using username and password
- username will be the same as workspace (only 1 workspace per user)

Later, ROSRS version 4 will be supported:
- authentication will be done using an access token
- users will be able to create many workspaces
